Motivation/Background Material:

The Monty Hall game was a famous television game that was hosted by Monty Hall in the 1980s, it is also
well-known because of its probability theory. However, During the 1990s there was a debate about whether there
existed a strategy behind this game. Various scientists and mathematicians investigated this game, trying to
determine a strategy/method. Shortly after, a woman by the name, of Vos Savant was the first to claim that players
should always switch door choices after the host revealed one of the doors to increase the chance of winning the
prize. Although it was concluded that this was the strategy for this game, various people, including myself, could not
put this into perspective. For that reason, we want to create a simulation to validate this strategy, especially under
different conditions. In addition, I would like to determine if adding a variant could affect the probability of winning
the prize, and how much of a difference it would make to the famous game show.




Problem Statement:

Visualize that you are in the Monty Hall game show, during the game show you are placed in an
environment with “n” doors. The number of doors will range from three, six, nine, twenty, and hundred, hence all
doors will contain a goat except one, which will contain the car (the grand price). Once all situated, you be given the
option to choose a door first, but it will not be opened. Not until the host reveals one or some of the doors depending
on the scenario, which will contain a goat. Keep in mind, that the game holds two policies which you either
randomly switch to one of the remaining doors or stick with your original selection. Depending on your decision this
will affect the probability of your chances of winning the car. However, knowing that there exists a strategy for
increasing your chances of winning the car, this strategy has only been applied when playing with three doors. Will
this strategy hold true when we add more doors and will it hold true when considering a variant, where the host falls
and accidentally opens one of the doors?
